# InventoryCPP
An inventory manager for a game
# Overview
This is a inventory manager for a game. While it is running it will keep track of the items the user has, it will let the user find new items, it will let the user inspect the items, and it will let the user drop items.

# Development Environment

The tools I used to make this program were some basic ones like VS code for my editor, Zoom for the video recording, and GitHub for a repository.

This was my first time programing using C++, it's slightly different than the other languages that I'm used to, like Python, but I dont find it overly confusing. I am curious as to why the randomness of generated numbers doesn't seem to work, but other than that I found it fairly easy to understand basic syntax.
